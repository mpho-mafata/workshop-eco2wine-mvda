# Exploratory Multivariate Data Analysis in Wine Sciences

<img src="/figures/winemaking.jpg">

Winemaking is a long process with tandem stages that feedback and influence each other. 
As a complex chemical solution, the study of wine is in itself, complicated.
This is why it is studies as a transdiciplinary discipline.
Some of the core disciplines include: Agriculture (viticulture), Economics, Engineering (process analytical technology - PAT, biotechnology),
Natural Sciences (Chemistry, Biochemistry, Microbiology), and Social science (Consumer and Sensory science).

# Tutorial 1: Data wrangling
This tutorial uses a typical oenological dataset <a href="https://github.com/mpho-mafata/workshop-eco2wine-mvda/blob/main/datasets">found here (data_wrangling)</a>.
